# Cloudflare Exporter for Prometheus
A "Cloudflare Exporter for Prometheus" could potentially be a tool or integration that allows Prometheus to gather metrics and data from Cloudflare services. This would enable users to monitor the performance, security, and other relevant aspects of their Cloudflare-managed services using Prometheus.

Such an exporter might work by utilizing Cloudflare's APIs to fetch information about various metrics like bandwidth usage, request rates, security events, and more. It would then transform this data into a format that Prometheus understands and can store for later querying, graphing, and alerting.
